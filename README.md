# Omnifood Project

Landing page of a fictional food company that delivers meals right to you.

My very first web development project with help from Jonas Schmedtmann's HTML & CSS course.

This page features a very nicely designed landing page with responsive design. It is fully interactable and has basic SEO.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (basic)

## What I Learned

This was my first real deep dive into advanced and more complex coding. I learned a lot of HTML and CSS:

- Basic elements
- Web page structure
- How to apply css rules
- CSS media queries and responsive design
- Working with VS Code
- Using Git and GitHub

## Biggest Obstacle

Because I was following a guided course I didn't encounter any major obstacles. Only finding time to code was a little hard.
